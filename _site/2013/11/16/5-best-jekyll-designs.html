<p>Whenever I’m embarking on a new design project, I typically start by surfing around to see some examples of how similar sites were designed. It’s a great way to get inspired as well as to inform yourself so that you can make sure your design is unique and memorable when compared to what’s already out there.</p>

<p>A lot has been said already about the merits of Jekyll as a minimalist publishing platform, but for a lot of Jekyll bloggers that minimalism extends to design as well. The handcrafted layouts I ran into while I was designing my own blog were some of the strongest examples of minimal, content-centric design that I’ve seen on the web. The 5 sites below are ones that I keep coming back to for inspiration when I’m working with a text-heavy project and a minimalist aesthetic.</p>

<h1>1. Warpspire, by <a href="https://twitter.com/kneath">@neath</a></h1>

<p><img src="/images/5-best-jekyll-designs/warpspire.png" alt="warpspire screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href="http://warpspire.com">Warpspire</a> is a great example of how a well-chosen and contrasting color palette combined with good vertical rhythm and typography can make a design pop without images or bright colors. Kyle Neath also has some great posts on design, making Warpspire a great place to get inspiration of all kinds.</p>

<h1>2. Sparanoid, by <a href="https://twitter.com/tunghsiao">@tunghsiao</a></h1>

<p><img src="/images/5-best-jekyll-designs/sparanoid.png" alt="sparanoid screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href="http://sparanoid.com/">Sparanoid</a> makes great use of hover attributes and a high contrast black-and-white aesthetic to create a spacious feel for the site homepage. Each of the posts is customized with a unique background color and heading icon (<a href="http://sparanoid.com/work/corner-bracket-lover/">some</a> <a href="http://sparanoid.com/work/instagram-badges/">examples</a>), adding personality and playfulness to the design while still keeping a very professional and tight layout.</p>

<h1>3. Zach Holman, by <a href="https://twitter.com/holman">@holman</a></h1>

<p><img src="/images/5-best-jekyll-designs/holman.png" alt="holman screenshot" /></p>

<p>Zach Holman&#39;s <a href="http://zachholman.com/">website</a> has a really nice layout that makes the most of large images in the header while still letting the content shine. Zach is another GitHubber, and if you haven&#39;t seen any of his talks before you should go check <a href="http://zachholman.com/talks">that section</a> of his site out. Not only are his talks interesting and informative, but his slides are great design examples in and of themselves</p>

<h1>4. Alex Cican, by <a href="https://twitter.com/alexcican">@alexcican</a></h1>

<p><img src="/images/5-best-jekyll-designs/cican.png" alt="cican screenshot" /></p>

<p>Alex Cican&#39;s <a href="http://alexcican.com/">portfolio</a> is a little bit rough around the edges in places, but it makes up for it with great use of images and a creative navigation system that mimics a restaurant menu (click the button in the upper right hand corner). It&#39;s a good example of how clean design can still convey a lot of personality.</p>

<h1>5. Minimal Mistakes Theme, by <a href="https://twitter.com/mmistakes">@mmistakes</a></h1>

<p><img src="/images/5-best-jekyll-designs/mmistakes.png" alt="minimal mistakes screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> is actually an open source Jekyll theme released by Michael Rose. It&#39;s similar in some ways to Zach Holman&#39;s site, but the thing that I like about it is how it includes a business card-like section of contact information and a photo next to every page on the site. Not only does the extra column help balance the content on the right, but it also adds a call-to-action to each page - if you like the author&#39;s work, a way to contact them is only a click away. </p>

<p>Jekyll is a great blogging platform because of its minimalism - it&#39;s simple enough to be convenient to use as well as not get in the way when you&#39;re trying to use it slightly differently than it was intended. These 5 examples show how simple software paired with stripped-down design can accomplish great things. </p>
