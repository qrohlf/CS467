One of the interesting characteristics of the modern transhumanism movement is the emphasis that it places on the improvement of human bodies at an individual level. While many organizations and movements seek to benefit humanity at a societal or economic level, transhumanism emphasizes the individual.

Body modification is one of the more publicized and controversial elements of transhumanism. The idea of using technology to not just repair our bodies but to enhance them goes against our cultural fear of "playing god". It also seems incredibly far-fetched to most people: modern prosthetics and medicine are currently just barely capable of replicating our limbs and organs, let alone surpassing their functionality. However, there are actually a number of promising new technologies out there that could take the issue of body modification out of the realm of the hypothetical.
