# Humanity could really use an upgrade.

At least, according to transhumanists it could. 

**Tranhumanism** is a movement to extend human physical and mental capabilities through technology. Sometimes abbreviated as *humanity+* or *H+*, Transhumanism is represented by a growing faction of scientists, policymakers, and thinkers who believe in the use of technology to enhance human life at an individual level.

The term itself was coined by the biologist Julian Huxley, as the title of his 1957 paper, *Transhumanism*, in which he wrote that:

> "...human life as we know it in history is a wretched makeshift, rooted in ignorance... it could be transcended by a state of existence based on the illumination of knowledge and comprehension"

While the technologies and prominent figures in Transhumanism have changed since Huxley's time, the core purpose of the movement has remained the same: *to make humans better*.
