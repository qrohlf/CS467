<h1>Heading 1</h1>

<p>"And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, you would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?"</p>

<p>"Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left."</p>

<p>"Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind.  Twelve from twenty leaves eight.  You must regain eight hours.  Do you wish to try to do so?"</p>

<p>"On foot?" asked Mr. Fogg.</p>

<p>"No; on a sledge," replied Fix.  "On a sledge with sails.  A man has proposed such a method to me."</p>

<p>It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer he had refused.</p>

<p>Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went up to him.  An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.</p>

<p>There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon which there was room for five or six persons.  A high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a large brigantine sail.  This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail.  Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle.  It was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop.  During the winter, when the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another. Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them, they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains.</p>

<p>Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.  The wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west.  The snow had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha.  Thence the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York.  It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected.</p>
