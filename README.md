# CS467

This is my lab coursework for fall 2014 CS467 (Advanced Graphics) taught by [Jeff Ely](http://legacy.lclark.edu/~jeff/). The directory structure is as follows:
- `bin/`: Compiled binaries are output here. 
- `examples/`: Utilities and examples that are provided by Jeff, but not directly needed for labs.
- `labs/`: My actual lab code for rendering scenes, movies, and whatnot.
- `lib/`: Libraries that are used in labs. Includes libraries from Jeff like D3d_matrix and light_model_student as well as libraries I wrote like vectors.
- `resources/`: Files from Jeff that are directly related to the labs. Includes scene descriptions and texture files.
- `tests/`: Self-explanatory.

## If you're a student from the class reading this:
- Feel free to look at the code, but please don't copy it verbatim.
- If you haven't seen Makefiles before, check out the GNU [intro to Makefiles](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction)
- The distributed parallel rendering code that I demoed in class is at [qrohlf/whale](https://github.com/qrohlf/whale).
